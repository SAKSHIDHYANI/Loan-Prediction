# Loan-Prediction
Loan Prediction analysis using machine learning algorithms along with the interface provided for the user.


Data set train.csv has been used for performing analysis of the loan prediction. Here loan prediction indicates whether user is eligible for getting loan.


The final_loan_approval_analysis.ipynb attached contains all the analysis performed to find the suitable alogorithm for the data provided. It contains graphs, confusion matrix related to the algorithms and their respective accuracy, precision and other properties to choose best among the algorithms.


The interface.py file attached contains the the code which was especially created for the user to enter specific details so that at the backend the most appropriate algorithm which was selected (as mentioned in the previous step) will be used respective to the details provided to indicate whether the user can apply for loan or not.


Idea of creating an interface was generated to hide the backend machine learing analysis from the end user as for the user, it should appear as a simple application which just asks for details of the user like income, age, marital status, creadit score and many more, and then gives the user idea whether he is eligible for loan or not


This interface can be used by the banking officials so that instead of manually handling the process of selecting the right person for loan approval, they can automate the process like this. Just entering the details and getting idea whether user/customer is laon eligible or not.

Also interface can be used by the customer also, to get an idea that whether they should apply for loan or not from that respective bank.
